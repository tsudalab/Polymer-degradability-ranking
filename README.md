## Data  
The experimental data of polymer degradability and literature data can be found in /Data  

The predicted degradability of PolyInfo data in model applicability domain can be found in (https://github.com/tsudalab/Polymer-degradability-ranking/blob/main/degradabilty_result_of_polyinfo.csv). The detailed information about polymers can be tracked through PID in (https://polymer.nims.go.jp/)  

## Model  
The model for degradability ranking can be found in /Model. 
## Applicability Domain determination of Polyinfo data  
The code for Applicability Domain determination can be found in (https://github.com/onecoinbuybus/KNN-Applicability-Domain/tree/main)
